==========

This repository is for the code for my "Startup Engineering" course that I am currently on Coursera.

Things should start to pick up fairly soon, and there should be a lot of SSJS code, HTML5/CSS3, and hopefully a `bitcoin` feature to receive startup investment & capital in... you guessed it, bitcoins!
