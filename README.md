==========

This repository is for the code for my "Startup Engineering" course that I am currently taking on Coursera.

Things should start to pick up fairly soon, and there should be a lot of SSJS code (node.js), HTML5/CSS3 (Twitter Bootstrap), and hopefully a ``bitcoin`` feature to receive startup investment & capital in... you guessed it, bitcoins!
